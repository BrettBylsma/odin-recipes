    <h2>Beef Smashburger with Toppings</h2>
    The beef smashburger is as simple and delicious way to enjoy a burger in the old school style.  
    Adding the onion and fried egg bring out the flavors of the beef and add a unique flavor you don't get with an ordinary burger.
    It's simple to make if you follow this recipe!  This recipe will use a Blackstone Griddle but a cast iron pan on a grill can also work!
